# Project3-covid-explorer
Exploring different ML algorithm and Solidity using COVID dataset
## Background
New startup has decided to run through covid explorer program in order to help one of the health institue for data analysis pupose. This program will be used to track the convid infection trend in last year and this year. It will also help sick visitor to guide testing loaction for covid test and using solidity functionality, company will calculate number of people vaccinated through covid vaccination program and store some documentation in the cloud. Necessary legal bodies have been contacted and they have given the green light on creating a tracking patient who are vaccinated. However, company is required to enable that no single person registered twice for vaccination on same day.

In order to launch this prgoram , company need to covid vaccine historical data which will be available and downloaded from the website.

This Program will run in four parts:
1. Data cleaning and data analysis Part
2. Ceating Dashboard using Python code and machine algorithm to plot different graphs using streamlit
3. Chatboat to communnnicate with the Public for covid related queries.
4. Solidity patient contract to verify whether patient has been vaccinated or not.
